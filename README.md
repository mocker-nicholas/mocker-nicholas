## Hello!,

My name is Nicholas Orth.

I am currently employed as a QA Automation Engineer. My time is split between 70% QA/Automation and 30% backend C# .NET development. I have a passion for problem solving :thinking:, continuous improvement :books:, and getting into the weeds of what makes something tick :desktop_computer:!
